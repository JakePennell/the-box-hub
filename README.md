# The Box Hub

## Hello and welcome to my very first Portfolio Porject for my Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). 

For my first project, I have created a website for a fictional boxing gym based in South London. The aim of my site is to encourage individuals of all ages and abilities to come and give boxing a go. Their motivation could be to increase their fitness, hone their boxing skills, be more confident, self defence, or just a bit of fun! 

Users of this website will be able to get all the information they for the following main points:

- WHO it caters for
- WHAT services the club offers
- WHEN you can attend the different classes
- HOW people can get in touch to get involved

You can see my website here: [The Box Hub](https://jakepennell.github.io/the-box-hub/)

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
- To maintain a strong, bold feel to the website, inkeeping with the theme of Boxing, I have chosen a distintive colour scheme. 
- The dark grey and black backgrounds are contrasted by an off-white, almost Ivory shade of white. 
- o add a pop of colour, I have used a neon purple in places. I have kept this to a minimal to ensure it stands out.

### Typography
- The two fonts used are Oxygen & Heebo with Sans Serif acting as a fallback if the fonts aren't imported correctly. 
- Oxygen & Heebo complient the Colour Scheme and general theme as they are strong and bold in style. 


### Imagery
- I have used very bold, striking images throughout the website. Capturing the community spirit of hard working individuals.

## Existing Features

### Logo

- The Logo I created is a strong, bold logo that sets the theme for the whole project. 
- It acts as an anchor to bring the user back to the home page when clicked. 

### Navigation

- The Navigation Bar is a clear and concise directory with fully working links to the Home, Gallry and Contact Us pages. 
- It is style with an underline for the active page and when hovered over, it changes colour to the neon purple that appears subtly throughout the website.

### Hero Image

- The Hero Image is a powerful image that draws the viewers attention to the fact this website is designed with boxing in mind. 
- The animation used to slowly zoom out gives it added visual appeal.
- The overlying text states in clear and simple terms what the business is and where it is based.

### About Us Bio

- The About Us sectio is a basic 'bio' of the business.
- It is designed to portay the message that this club is accessable to all ages and skill levels. 
- The styling is inkeeping with the general them.
- I have included a call to action by signing up for a free class. This is delivered via a working link to the contact us page. Highlighted by bold and colourful text.

### About Us Image 

- This black and white image of a man boxing serves to break up the about us section and the timetable. Without this, the home page would be too wordy and not visually appealing.

### Timetable

- The simple box method works really well to show the viewer what classes are available and when. 
- The icons are an added bit of visuals to make the section more interesting viewing.

## Contact Us Page

- As mentiond in th About Us section, the website offers the viewer the chance to claim a free class. 
- This is acheived by completing the contact form and selecting the desired goal. Fitness, Boxing Skills or Self Defense.
- I have used the https://formdump.codeinstitute.net as the destination for the submitted data as it is just a 'dummy' form.
