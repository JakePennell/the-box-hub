# The Box Hub

Hello and welcome to my very first Portfolio Porject for my Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). 

For my first project, I have created a website for a fictional boxing gym based in South London. The aim of my site is to encourage individuals of all ages and abilities to come and give boxing a g. Their attraction could be to increase their fitness , hone their boxing skills, be more confident in self defence, or just a bit of fun! 

You can see my website here: [The Box Hub](https://jakepennell.github.io/the-box-hub/)
