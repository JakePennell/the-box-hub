# The Box Hub

## Hello and welcome to my very first Portfolio Porject for my Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). 

For my first project, I have created a website for a fictional boxing gym based in South London. The aim of my site is to encourage individuals of all ages and abilities to come and give boxing a go. Their motivation could be to increase their fitness, hone their boxing skills, be more confident, self defence, or just a bit of fun! 

The theme is distinct. With mainly darker backgrounds with off-white text. However there is an occasional pop of colour from the neon purple thats is used sparingly. 

Users of this website will be able to get all the information they for the following main points:

- WHO it caters for
- WHAT services the club offers
- WHEN you can attend the different classes
- HOW people can get in touch to get involved

You can see my website here: [The Box Hub](https://jakepennell.github.io/the-box-hub/)

## Existing Features

### Logo

- The Logo I created is a strong, bold logo that sets the theme for the whole project. 
- It acts as an anchor to bring the user back to the home page when clicked. 

### Navigation

- The Navigation Bar is a clear and concise directory with fully working links to the Home, Gallry and Contact Us pages. 
- It is style with an underline for the active page and when hovered over, it changes colour to the neon purple that appears subtly throughout the website.

### Hero Image

- The Hero Image is a powerful image that draws the viewers attention to the fact this website is designed with boxing in mind. 
- The animation used to slowly zoom out gives it added visual appeal.
- The overlying text states in clear and simple terms what the business is and where it is based.

### About Us Bio

- The About Us sectio is a basic 'bio' of the business.
- It is designed to portay the message that this club is accessable to all ages and skill levels. 
- The styling is inkeeping with the general them.
- I have included a call to action by signing up for a free class. This is delivered via a working link to the contact us page. Highlighted by bold and colourful text.

### About Us Image 

- This black and white image of a man boxing serves to break up the about us section and the timetable. Without this, the home page would be too wordy and not visually appealing.

### Timetable

- The simple box method works really well to show the viewer what classes are available and when. 
- The icons are an added bit of visuals to make the section more interesting viewing.

## Gallery 

- The Gallery page is used to show the viewer what they can expect at one of the classes. 
- The styling is simple but effective with a tiled effect, images seperated by a thin white border.

## Contact Us Page

- As mentiond in th About Us section, the website offers the viewer the chance to claim a free class. 
- This is acheived by completing the contact form and selecting the desired goal. Fitness, Boxing Skills or Self Defense.
- I have used the https://formdump.codeinstitute.net as the destination for the submitted data as it is just a 'dummy' form.

## Future Features

To further improve my website, I would like to add additonal features in the future These include:
1. A map of where the gym can be found.
2. A 'meet the team' page with a personal bio of the gym trainers.
3. Videos of classes in session as part of the Gallery page.
