# The Box Hub

Hello and welcome to my very first Portfolio Porject for my Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). 

For my first project, I have created a website for a fictional boxing gym based in South London. The aim of my site is to encourage individuals of all ages and abilities to come and give boxing a go. Their motivation could be to increase their fitness, hone their boxing skills, be more confident, self defence, or just a bit of fun! 

Users of this website will be able to get all the information they for the following main points:

WHO to caters for

WHAT classes the club offers 

WHEN you can attend the different classes

HOW people can get in touch to get involved





You can see my website here: [The Box Hub](https://jakepennell.github.io/the-box-hub/)
